# Common Algebra Mistakes

## Quadratic Equations

### Mistake 1: Forgetting ± in Quadratic Formula
❌ x = (-b + √(b²-4ac)) / 2a
✅ x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a

Both roots must be considered!

### Mistake 2: Dividing by Variable
❌ x² = 2x → x = 2 (lost x = 0)
✅ x² - 2x = 0 → x(x - 2) = 0 → x = 0 or x = 2

Never divide by a variable that could be zero!

### Mistake 3: Wrong Discriminant Application
❌ Assuming D > 0 always means two positive roots
✅ D > 0 means two real roots (may be positive, negative, or both)

Check sign of roots using Vieta's formulas.

## Exponents and Logarithms

### Mistake 4: Incorrect Exponent Rules
❌ (a + b)² = a² + b²
✅ (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

### Mistake 5: Log of Sum
❌ log(a + b) = log(a) + log(b)
✅ log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)

Log of sum ≠ sum of logs!

### Mistake 6: Negative Under Even Root
❌ √(x²) = x
✅ √(x²) = |x|

Square root gives positive value only.

### Mistake 7: Domain of Logarithm
❌ Solving log(x) = -2 → x = 10⁻² = 0.01 without checking
✅ Always verify that argument is positive: x = 0.01 > 0 ✓

## Inequalities

### Mistake 8: Not Reversing Sign
❌ -2x > 6 → x > -3
✅ -2x > 6 → x < -3 (reverse inequality when dividing by negative)

### Mistake 9: Squaring Both Sides
❌ x > -2 → x² > 4 (wrong!)
✅ Must consider cases when squaring inequalities

Only valid if both sides are non-negative.

## Polynomials

### Mistake 10: Partial Fraction Decomposition
❌ 1/(x(x+1)) = A/x + A/(x+1) (using same A)
✅ 1/(x(x+1)) = A/x + B/(x+1) (different constants)

### Mistake 11: Remainder Theorem Application
❌ Remainder when dividing by (2x - 1) is P(1)
✅ Remainder is P(1/2) (set 2x - 1 = 0, so x = 1/2)

## General Algebraic Errors

### Mistake 12: Sign Errors
Most common error! Always double-check signs in:
- Negative number multiplication
- Subtracting expressions
- Distributing negatives

### Mistake 13: Order of Operations
PEMDAS/BODMAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction

❌ 3 + 4 × 2 = 14
✅ 3 + 4 × 2 = 11

## Prevention Strategies
1. Always verify answer by substitution
2. Check domain restrictions
3. Consider special cases (x = 0, negative x)
4. Draw sign charts for inequalities
5. Use discriminant to predict root nature
