# Quadratic Equations

## Standard Form
A quadratic equation has the form: **ax² + bx + c = 0** where a ≠ 0

## Quadratic Formula
The solutions (roots) of ax² + bx + c = 0 are:
$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Discriminant
The discriminant D = b² - 4ac determines the nature of roots:
- **D > 0**: Two distinct real roots
- **D = 0**: One repeated real root (x = -b/2a)
- **D < 0**: Two complex conjugate roots

## Vieta's Formulas
For ax² + bx + c = 0 with roots α and β:
- Sum of roots: α + β = -b/a
- Product of roots: αβ = c/a

## Factoring Methods
1. **Direct Factoring**: ax² + bx + c = a(x - α)(x - β)
2. **Completing the Square**: x² + bx = (x + b/2)² - (b/2)²
3. **Middle Term Splitting**: Find two numbers that multiply to ac and add to b

## Solution Steps
1. Write equation in standard form (ax² + bx + c = 0)
2. Identify coefficients a, b, c
3. Calculate discriminant D = b² - 4ac
4. Apply quadratic formula or appropriate method
5. Simplify and verify roots

## Common Examples
- x² - 5x + 6 = 0 → x = 2, x = 3
- x² + 4x + 4 = 0 → x = -2 (repeated)
- x² - 2x + 5 = 0 → x = 1 ± 2i (complex)

## JEE-Style Applications
- Finding the condition for common roots
- Forming equations with transformed roots (α+1, β+1)
- Equations with roots that are reciprocals, squares, or cubes of original roots
